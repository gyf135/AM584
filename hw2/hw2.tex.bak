{\bf Problem 1.}
Find (by hand) both the reduced and full SVD of the matrix
\[
A = \bcm 0&3\\ 2&0\\ 0&4\ecm.
\]
Remember that things should be ordered so that $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2$.

Use the SVD to determine the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The best rank-1 approximation to $A$.
\item The 2-norm of $A$.
\item A basis for the linear subspace $\{x \in \reals^2:
      \|Ax\|_2 = \|A\|_2 \|x\|_2\}$ and the dimension of this space.
\item A basis for the orthogonal complement of the range of $A$.
\item A basis for the null space of $A^T$.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Solution:}\\
Finding the SVD of A consists of calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $AA^T$ and $A^TA$. The eigenvectors of $A^TA$ make up the columns of V, the eigenvectors of $AA^T$ make up the columns of U and the singular values in $\Sigma$ are square roots of eigenvalues from $AA^T$ or $A^TA$. The singular values are diagonal entries of the $\Sigma$ matrix and are arranged in descending order. The singular values are always real numbers. Since the matrix A is a real matrix, U and V are also real.\\
\centerline {Let $B = AA^T = \bcm 0&3\\ 2&0\\ 0&4\ecm \bcm 0&2&0\\ 3&0&4\ecm = \bcm 9&0&12\\0&4&0\\12&0&16\\\ecm$}\\
\centerline {Let $C = A^TA = \bcm4&0\\0&25\ecm$}\\
To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can solve $det(B - \lambda I) = 0$ for $\lambda$ where $det$ denotes the determinant and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalues of matrix B. Then we find that the eigenvalues of B are $\lambda_1 = 25, \lambda_2 = 4, and \lambda_3 = 0$. Note that $\lambda_1 $ and $\lambda_2$ are the eigenvalues of matrix C. For eigenvalues, we can calculate the eigenvectors respectively. As for $\lambda_1$, $BV_{B1} = \lambda_1V_{B1} \Rightarrow V_{B1} = \bcm 0.6\\0\\0.8\ecm$ and $CV_{C1} = \lambda_1V_{C1} \Rightarrow V_{C1} = \bcm 0\\1\ecm$. As for $\lambda_2$, $BV_{B2} = \lambda_2V_{B2} \Rightarrow V_{B2} = \bcm 0\\1\\0\ecm$ and $CV_{C2} = \lambda_2V_{C2} \Rightarrow V_{C2} = \bcm 1\\0\ecm$. As for $\lambda_3$, $BV_{B3} = \lambda_3V_{B3} = 0 \Rightarrow V_{B3} = \bcm 0.8\\0\\-0.6\ecm$.\\
Now that we have calculated the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The full SVD of matrix A can be written as:\\
\centerline {$U = \bcm 0.6&0&0.8\\0&1&0\\0.8&0&-0.6\ecm$, $\Sigma = \bcm 5&0\\0&2\\0&0\ecm$ and $V = \bcm 0&1\\1&0\ecm$}\\
Double check that $U\Sigma V^* = A$ (Always needed since the eigenvectors can be of opposite sign).\\
Since the matrix A is of rank 2, there are only two singular values. The reduce SVD of matrix A can be interpreted as:\\
\centerline {$\hat{U} = \bcm 0.6&0\\0&1\\0.8&0\ecm$, $\hat{\Sigma} = \bcm 5&0\\0&2\ecm$ and $V = \bcm 0&1\\1&0\ecm$}\\
Double check that $\hat{U}\hat{\Sigma} V^* = A$\\

The best rank-1 approximation is thus $u_1\sigma_1 v_1^* = 5 \bcm 0.6\\0\\0.8\ecm \bcm 0&1\ecm = \bcm 0&3\\0&0\\0&4\ecm$\\
where $u_1$ and $v_1$ is the first column in matrix $U$ and $V$ respectively. And $\sigma_1$ is the largest singular value\\

The 2-norm of A: $\parallel A\parallel_2 = \sigma_1 = 5$\\

To interpret the subspace, let $x = \bcm x_1\\x_2\ecm$, and $Ax = \bcm 3x_2\\2x_1\\4x_2\ecm$. Then the subspace should satisfy $[(3x_2)^2+(2x_1)^2+(4x_2)^2]^\frac{1}{2} = 5 \times (x_1^2+x_2^2)^\frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 \in R$.\\
Therefore, the basis of the subspace is $\{\bcm 0\\1\ecm\}$ and thus the subspace is just a line. Therefore the dimension of subspace is 1.\\

The $range(A) = Ax = \bcm 3x_2\\2x_1\\4x_2\ecm$, $\forall x_1,x_2 \in R$. And thus the orthogonal complement is $\bcm y_1\\y_2\\y_3\ecm$, $\{y_1, y_2, y_3 \in \mathbb{R} : x^Ty = 0\}$. In order to make the equation $x^Ty = 0$ true $\forall x_1,x_2 \in \mathbb{R}$, $y_2 = 0$ and $y_3 = -\frac{3}{4}y_1$. Therefore, the orthogonal complement of the range of matrix A is $Y = y_1\bcm 1\\0\\-\frac{3}{4}\ecm$. And the basis of it is $\bcm 1\\0\\-\frac{3}{4}\ecm$\\

$A^T = \bcm 0&2&0\\3&0&4\ecm$ and let $A^Tx = 0 \Rightarrow \bcm 0&2&0\\3&0&4\ecm \bcm x_1\\x_2\\x_3\ecm = \bcm 2x_2\\3x_1+4x_3\ecm = \bcm 0\\0\ecm$. Solve the equation, we have $x_2 = 0$ and $x_3 = -\frac{3}{4}x_1$. Therefore, the basis for the null space of $A^T$ is $\bcm 1\\0\\-\frac{3}{4}\ecm$\\

In fact, it can be shown that if the subspace is described as the range of a matrix, then the orthogonal complement is the set of vectors orthogonal to the rows of $A$, which is the nullspace of $A^T$

{\bf Problem 2.}
Determine by hand the SVD of the matrix
\[
A = \bcm 17&1\\ 6&18\ecm.
\]
Hint: one right singular vector is
\[
v_1 = \bcm 1/\sqrt{2}\\ 1/\sqrt{2} \ecm.
\]


% uncomment the next two lines if you want to insert solution...
\vskip 1cm
{\bf Solution:}
Based on the fact that the right singular vector is unitary, we can solve it with $v_1 = \bcm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ecm$\\, which gives:\\
\centerline {$V = \bcm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ecm$} \\
\centerline {$AV = \bcm 17&1\\6&18\ecm \bcm\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ecm = \bcm\frac{18}{\sqrt{2}}&\frac{16}{\sqrt{2}}\\\frac{24}{\sqrt{2}}&-\frac{12}{\sqrt{2}}\ecm $}\\

Notice that $U\Sigma = AV = \bcm\frac{18}{\sqrt{2}}&\frac{16}{\sqrt{2}}\\\frac{24}{\sqrt{2}}&-\frac{12}{\sqrt{2}}\ecm$. Since $U$ is also a unitary matrix, it can be solved that $U = \bcm \frac{3}{5}&\frac{4}{5}\\\frac{4}{5}&-\frac{3}{5}\ecm$ and $\Sigma = \bcm \frac{30}{\sqrt{2}}&0\\0&\frac{20}{\sqrt{2}}\ecm$

{\bf Problem 3.}
Exercise 6.1 in Trefethen and Bau.  In addition,
illustrate with a sketch showing the effect of $A = I-2P$ on a typical vector
$v$ for the case
\[
P = \frac 1 5 \bcm 1&2\\2&4\ecm.
\]
Also explain why a matrix $A$ of this form is sometimes called a
``reflector''.  {\bf Hint:} See also Figure 10.2 in the book and the
discussion for the case of a ``Householder reflector''.

Exercise 6.1:\\
If P is an orthogonal projector, then I - 2P is unitary.\\
{\bf Solution:}\\
\centerline {$(I-2P)(I-2P)^* = (I-2P)(I-2P^*) = I - 2P - 2P^* + 4PP^*$}\\
And since for orthogonal projector, $P = P^* = P^2$, the equation above becomes:\\
\centerline {$(I-2P)(I-2P)^* = I - 2P - 2P + 4P^2 = I - 4P + 4P = I$}\\
Therefore, $I-2P$ is unitary.\\

Let $P = \frac{1}{5}\bcm 1&2\\2&4\ecm$ and then $A = I - 2P = \bcm 1&0\\0&1\ecm - \frac{2}{5}\bcm 1&2\\2&4\ecm = \bcm \frac{3}{5}&-\frac{2}{5}\\-\frac{2}{5}&-\frac{3}{5}\ecm$\\
As for a general vector $v = \bcm v_1\\v_2\ecm$, we have $Av = \bcm \frac{3}{5}v_1 - \frac{2}{5}v_2\\- \frac{2}{5}v_1 - \frac{3}{5}v_2\ecm$
