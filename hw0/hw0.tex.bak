\begin{itemize} 
\item Complete the survey found at
\url{https://catalyst.uw.edu/webq/survey/rjl/312826} 
to tell us about your background, and to let us know what email
account to use for setting up a shared Dropbox folder (shared only
between you and the instructor and TA).

\item Complete one of the two surveys below to help us schedule office hours
at good times:

    \begin{itemize} 
    \item For on-campus 584A students: \url{http://whenisgood.net/b3cmwe5}
    \item For on-line 584B students: \url{http://whenisgood.net/7d32ttc}
    \end{itemize} 

\item Install {\tt git} on your computer if necessary and clone the class
respository as described at \\
\url{http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am584a2016/class_repos.html}\\  
You will need to do this to get the {\tt hw0.tex} file needed for the next step.

\item Fill in your name and netid where
indicated in the latex file {\tt hw0.tex}, run latex to 
convert to a pdf, and submit {\em both} {\tt hw0.tex} and {\tt hw0.pdf}
via your Dropbox folder.

\item Check that you have access to Matlab and/or Python with the NumPy
module.  See \\
\url{http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am584a2016/software.html}\\
